## Session 1 — 2026-08-18 — Wire the DML loader into the GUI

**Focus:** Resolve whether the GUI hid a newer migration codebase, then close the gap it exposed — get the second-stage normaliser running behind the GUI so the full two-stage pipeline needs no terminal. Ship it as one verified patch.
**Status:** `completed`

---

### Context

This follows a longer recovery arc (predating this worksheet): reconstructing the missing second stage `db_dml_loader.py`, rotating a leaked Supabase DB password, untangling a 1.47 GB large-file push and a PowerShell↔WSL2 line-ending divergence, and a three-way reconciliation of the live `rat` schema against the hand-written DDL and the loader. Coming back after ~a year, a nagging question remained: did the tkinter GUI wrap an *updated* migration engine, or was it just a shell around the two original CLI scripts? This session answered that and then wired in the half that was missing.

---

### Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered |
|---|---|---|
| Confirmed GUI is an **extract-only wrapper**; the refactored extract is behaviourally identical to the original | Grep showed `gui_operations.py` shells out to `filemaker_extract_refactored.py` only; escaping + `df_to_sql_bulk_insert` (incl. the `ratcatalogue` picture→image_no swap) match the original byte-for-byte | Assuming the GUI held newer logic and patching against it (would have been wrong) |
| Wire the loader into the GUI via `subprocess`, mirroring the extract path | Leaves the crown-jewel loader untouched; reuses the existing `run_python_command` mechanism | Importing the loader as a module (tighter coupling, risk); rewriting the loader (unnecessary) |
| `Load to Target` runs `dml_files` mode, gated on **target connection only** | The file route carries the loader's full sanitisation/quarantine; the loader needs Supabase, not FileMaker | `migration_schema`/staging mode (stale-files risk); gating on both connections (over-strict — the loader never touches FileMaker) |
| Read `export.path` from `config.toml` at dispatch time | `OperationManager` holds no config; avoids threading config through GUI constructors | Hardcoding a path (brittle); adding config plumbing to `OperationManager` (larger, riskier patch) |
| Ship all changes as **one** `git apply` patch, verified against a pristine `HEAD` | Nothing from the chat had been applied yet; one reviewable, reversible artifact | Multiple separate diffs/files (harder to apply cleanly and in the right order) |

---

### Commands

```bash
# [APPLIED] Confirm the GUI wraps the extract, not the loader — nothing imports db_dml_loader
grep -rnE "db_dml_loader|migrate_catalog|batch_upsert" gui/     # -> no matches
grep -nE "filemaker_extract_refactored" gui/gui_operations.py    # -> subprocess target
```

```bash
# [APPLIED] Apply the GUI wiring with strict single-anchor matching, then syntax-check
python3 /tmp/patcher.py            # 9 edits across 3 files, fails loudly if any anchor != 1 match
python3 -m py_compile gui/gui_operations.py gui/gui_widgets.py gui/filemaker_gui.py scripts/db_dml_loader.py
```

```bash
# [APPLIED] Build the combined patch (loader fix + constraints SQL + GUI wiring) and verify it applies to a clean HEAD
git add -N supabase/schema/fix_rat_constraints.sql
git diff HEAD > picaloco_pipeline.patch
git archive HEAD | tar -x -C /tmp/verify && (cd /tmp/verify && git init -q && git add -A && git commit -qm base \
  && git apply --check --verbose ../picaloco_pipeline.patch)   # -> APPLIES CLEANLY
```

```bash
# [APPLIED — by user] Apply and push
git apply picaloco_pipeline.patch      # (use --3way on Windows/WSL2 if CRLF trips it)
git add -A && git commit -m "Wire db_dml_loader into GUI; fix catalog_metadata/usage upsert keys; add constraint prereqs"
git push
```

```sql
-- [RECOMMENDED — not yet run] Prerequisite DDL. Must run against the live `rat` schema BEFORE the next loader run.
-- File shipped by the patch at supabase/schema/fix_rat_constraints.sql
-- Adds UNIQUE (catalog_id) on catalog_metadata (required by the loader's new ON CONFLICT),
-- drops the duplicate picture_metadata FK, and includes a duplicate-catalog_id pre-check.
```

---

### Outcome

The tkinter GUI now exposes a **Load to Target** button that runs `db_dml_loader.py --mode dml_files` against the export directory from `config.toml`. The full FileMaker → normalised `rat.*` pipeline is now reachable end-to-end from the GUI (**Export to Files → Load to Target**), with no command line required — the original goal behind adding a GUI in the first place. Everything was delivered as `picaloco_pipeline.patch` (five files: the loader upsert-key fix, the new `fix_rat_constraints.sql`, and the three GUI files), verified to apply cleanly against a pristine `HEAD` and to compile afterwards. The patch is now applied and pushed.

The side investigation also settled the "does the GUI hide newer code?" question for good: the GUI's extract is a faithful, byte-equivalent refactor of the original — no divergent migration logic, no drift risk switching CLI↔GUI. The only real asymmetry was the missing second stage, which this session fixed.

---

### Gotchas & Notes

- **Output doesn't stream.** `run_python_command` uses `subprocess.run(capture_output=True)`, so during an hour-long load the GUI shows nothing until it finishes — a client will think it's hung. `Popen` line-streaming is the real fix (next session).
- **Stale-files footgun.** `Load to Target` reads whatever `.sql` files are on disk (`dml_files` mode). Running **Full Sync** (the `--db-exp` staging route) and *then* `Load to Target` would point the loader at possibly-stale files. Intended flow is Export to Files → Load to Target. A second mode-aware button (or wiring Full Sync to `migration_schema` mode) removes this.
- **Order matters:** `fix_rat_constraints.sql` must run against live `rat` **before** the loader, or the new `ON CONFLICT (catalog_id)` errors on the missing unique constraint. Run its dedupe pre-check first.
- **Patch line endings:** generated on Linux (LF). On the Windows/WSL2 checkout, `git apply --3way` sidesteps CRLF mismatches (it merges against the normalised index blob).
- **Requirements smell:** `requirements.txt` lists `sqlalchemy`/`psycopg2-binary` but not `supabase` (supabase-py), while the loader references `supabase.table(...)` in places. Worth confirming which client path is actually live — a leftover from the mixed-client state noted earlier.

### Open Threads

- [ ] Run `fix_rat_constraints.sql` against the live `rat` schema, then re-run a small test load to confirm the upsert-key fix works end-to-end.
- [ ] Check live row counts on `catalog_metadata` / `usage` — determine whether those two tables ever loaded under the old (broken) `id = image_no` code.
- [ ] Add `Popen` line-streaming so GUI operations show live progress (makes the loader run feel client-ready).
- [ ] Add a second mode-aware button, or wire Full Sync's staging route to the loader's `migration_schema` mode, to eliminate the stale-files risk.
- [ ] Extend the idempotency fix to the remaining five `batch_upsert` calls still conflicting on the auto-UUID `id`: `collection`, `photographer`, `builder` (→ conflict on `name`), `picture_metadata` (→ `catalog_id`), and `catalog_builder` (needs a composite-uniqueness decision).
- [ ] Confirm the live supabase-py vs SQLAlchemy client path in the loader; prune the dead one.
- [ ] Rotate the anon JWT once the frontend is ready to receive a new key (deliberately parked).
- [ ] Consolidate `filemaker_sync` + `picaloco_rest` into `PicaLocoBackend`; rebrand `rat`→`picaloco` only after consolidation is stable.
